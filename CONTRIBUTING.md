## Updates

If you would like to work on updates to the code or documentation, we simply ask you follow this simple process:
1. Have an [Issue](../../issues) registered, there may already be an [Issue](../../issues) created, if so add a comment that you'd like to work on fixing it, if not please create a new [Issue](../../issues) and add a comment you would like to work on it.
1. Fork this project and create a branch for your changes, make sure to include the issue number in the branch name.
1. Wait for your issue to get a release number assigned, this will show in the milestone section (if we don't know your working on the issue it might not have a release assigned see step above).
1. when your changes are ready make a pull request for your branch to the release branch (it will have the same number as the milestone assigned to your issue)

Pull requests to master that have code changes will be rejected, and should be made to a version numbered branch.
